# Java-MySQL CRUD Application
This is a team project that involved creating a CRUD application using Java and MySQL server. We chose to design a volunteers database that keeps a record of organizations, volunteers and different projects in each organization. We worked together in designing the database, crafting the outline of what our projects should look like and how it should function. Then, each of us took an individual table within the databse to work on and implement CRUD functionality for that table. 

Renee worked on the Organizations table which also involved authoring the OrganizationDao, the Organization entity, and crafting the Organization Menu. 

Nawaraj took on the task of working with the Volunteers table. Like Renee, Nawaraj also authored VolunteersDao, the Volunteers entity, and the Volunteers Menu. 

Sean worked on the Projects table, which also involved authoring ProjectsDao, the Projects entity and the Projects Menu.

For each of the table, you can do the following:
  1. Create a record in the table 
  2. Read a record in the table
  3. Update a record in the table
  4. Delete a record in the table
